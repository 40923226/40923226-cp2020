<p id="N1069E" lang="">In this module, we are going to cover the various types of networks, including local area networks, wide area networks, personal area networks, and metropolitan area networks. Next, we will cover the various network relationships, such as client/server and peer-to-peer, and focus on the types of resources our networks use. Finally, we will talk about the topologies of our networks, such as the bus, the ring, the star, the full mesh, and hybrid network topologies.</p>
<h2 contenteditable="true" lang=""><span title="Quick scroll up">Network Defined By Geography</span></h2>
<p lang="">Networks are defined by the geography they cover. We start with the area around a single person, with this area being termed the personal area network (PAN). Next, we expand outward to the local area network (LAN), which can contain an entire office floor or building. Moving outward again, we have the metropolitan area network, which covers the area across the city by connecting multiple LANs together. Finally, we have the wide area network (WAN). This is the largest network we define by geography and it can go across the country or even across the world. A great example of a WAN is the Internet, since it connects many networks together and stretches across the globe.</p>
<h2 contenteditable="true" lang=""><span title="Quick scroll up">Personal Area Network</span></h2>
<p id="N106E1" lang="">A PAN has a very small range limited to just a few meters. If you stretch your hands out at your sides and spin around in a circle, this is the physical range of most PANs. Bluetooth is one of the main things we use to create a PAN, although USB and infrared can also be used for these networks. Bluetooth has a range between one meter and 100 meters depending on which class of Bluetooth you are using, but most common Bluetooth devices are class two devices limited to 10 meters. Some good examples of PANs are the connection between a USB hard drive and a laptop, or a Bluetooth cellphone connecting to your car stereo system wirelessly.</p>
<p></p><h2>Develop</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mdecourse/cmsimde">https://github.com/mdecourse/cmsimde</a> 的開發, 可以在一個目錄中放入 cmsimde, 然後將 up_dir 中的內容放到與 cmsimde 目錄同位階的地方, 使用 command 進入 cmsimde 目錄, 執行 python wsgi.py, 就可以啟動, 以瀏覽器 https://localhost:9443 就可以連接, 以 admin 作為管理者密碼, 就可以登入維護內容.</p>
<p>cmsimde 的開發採用 Leo Editor, 開啟 cmsimde 目錄中的 cmsimde.leo 就可以進行程式修改, 結束後, 若要保留網際內容, 只要將 cmsimde 外部的內容倒回 up_dir 目錄中即可後續對 cmsimde 遠端倉儲進行改版.</p>
<p>init.py 位於  up_dir 目錄, 可以設定 site_title 與 uwsgi 等變數.</p>
